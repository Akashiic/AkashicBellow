/**
 * A generator that shapes the deep layer ({@code minY <= y < 0}) together with Bellow, registered with
 * {@link BellowAPI#registerGenerator}. Every method runs on the server thread, for dimensions with deep layers only,
 * and has an empty default. Generators run by priority, then id; an exception is logged and the chunk goes on (a stack
 * overflow or another {@code VirtualMachineError} is not caught: it crashes the server with a report, because the
 * frames it unwound may have been nested chunk loads).
 * <p>
 * Bellow places no content below 0: the generators make the deep layer (its fill, its floor, its ores, its caves).
 * Order for one chunk, mirroring 1.18 (noise terrain and carvers, then features, then light):
 * <ol>
 * <li>Bellow creates the sections from the floor up to Y -1, empty.</li>
 * <li>{@link #generateTerrain} of every generator. Then Bellow replaces the legacy bedrock at Y 0..4 where Y -1 is
 * solid (its only write at Y >= 0), opening the old world into the new layer.</li>
 * <li>Once the chunk and its 8 neighbours have their terrain: {@link #decorate} of every generator. The chunk is marked
 * decorated.</li>
 * <li>After the world tick: the changed sections are sent again to players who already received them, then
 * {@link #onDecorated}.</li>
 * <li>After the world tick, once the 5x5 chunks around it are loaded and decorated: Bellow lights what the generators
 * placed (block light of every light source of the chunk, below 0), then {@link #onLit}.</li>
 * </ol>
 * A dimension without any generator gets a provisional layer (stone over a bedrock floor) in chunks that stay not
 * generated; the first generator installed later receives those chunks as retrogen chunks.
 * <p>
 * Each step runs once per chunk, ever: what each generator did is saved with the chunk
 * ({@link BellowAPI#getGeneratorStages}), so a step that could not run before the chunk was unloaded (or the server
 * stopped) runs when it loads again. Chunks whose deep layer was generated before a generator was installed are never
 * handed to it, so it cannot cut through what players built there.
